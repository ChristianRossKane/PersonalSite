## Christian Kane's Personal Website

This is a place where I have compiled all relevant coursework and projects, alongside containing a .pdf of my resume.

I decided it was time to have a visually appealing place to display some of my work over the past few years. If you have any questions or want to reach out to me, my email is christiankane@tamu.edu.
